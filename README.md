# CS8803-LCS-Project-1
Please change the argument in the RunExperiment( ) function in main.py, then run main.py to use DPLL algorithm with the corresponding heuristic to solve the SAT problems. For the function argument, “JW” stands for the Jeroslow-Wang heuristic, “TC” stands for the 2 clause heuristic, and “R” stands for the random heuristic. If you use other strings as the argument, the program would output “No corresponding heuristic. Please check your input.” The experiment results will be saved as csv files in the project folder, with the N value and heuristic as the names.
