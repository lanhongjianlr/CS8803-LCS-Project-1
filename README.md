Please run the Convert2CNF.py to create the dimacs file for the Einstein puzzle. The created file would be named as Einstein.cnf.\\
To solve the CNF, run the main.py. If the CNF is satisfiable, the program would output "The CNF is satisfiable." and a satisfying assignment of the propositions; if not, the program would output "The CNF is unsatisfiable."
